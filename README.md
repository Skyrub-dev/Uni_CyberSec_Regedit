# Uni_CyberSec
A small very basic virus and anti-virus written in C++

The purpose of this code is to showcase how viruses can infect the windows registry, this code will simply create a new registry key called 'MSPaint', it has no function and is just there as an example.

You can remove the registry via the anti-virus included, or you can manually delete the registry stored in:
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
